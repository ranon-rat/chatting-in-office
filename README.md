# chatting-in-office
Simple chat program that I made for chatting with the homies in the office.
# how to run it
Its really simple, you dont need to configure too  many stuff, you only need to run the executable and that will be all.

If you want you can compile it yourself by using the next command
```
go build main.go
```
# how it works?

It works with libp2p, its really simple and it can have some issues at big scale but I dont think that is a big deal when you are talking to a few people.
